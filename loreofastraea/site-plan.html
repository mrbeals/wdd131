			<p>The Mirror’s Boon
A Guide to the World
The Legend of Orion Dawnbringer
And the Unity of Nations
Many thousands of years ago lived a man named Orion Dawnbringer. He lived in a small village just outside of the boundaries of the nine kingdoms that belonged to the gods and goddesses. Orion was a visionary man who could think in ways no one else could. Tired of a world consumed by wars, he set off on a quest to unify the world. 
And he was successful.
Flying a banner of one nation he became their king, made piece with the deities and brought an era of piece that none could rival. He established the wonderful city of Tír na nÓg, a safe haven where the ancient Tuatha De lived. These were glorious people who truly sought a better world. 
Orion made a discovery of a beautiful crystal flower and named it a “Mirror Crystal”. These shimmering buds stored tremendous energy and hinted at something more. With his vast knowledge he created a unique artifact beyond artifacts, The Mirror Portal. This gave a glimpse into other realities and allowed communication between other realities that also had a Mirror Portal. This led to a time period of tremendous growth and technological advancement as they learned from the other realities. This was a perfect time indeed. 
But alas, even the best of times can end in an instant. 
The advisors of Orion Dawnbringer also used this portal to inquire about their fearless leader to see what he had accomplished in their realities. They were horrified to learn that in every other reality Orion was the most evil and feared being who posed the greatest threat to civilization. Fearing that this could be the case here as well, the advisors conspired together to eliminate the threat to save their reality. And murdered Orion Dawnbringer upon his throne when he least expected it. 
Orion’s wife, Phoebe Dawnsinger, was devastated to hear this news. She mourned the loss of a great man who loved her and their son. She delved into her studies, convinced that there was a way to bring him back. Using the Mirror Crystals, she discovered a way to do just that. Bringing his body to the Catacombs, she performed a mysterious ritual that did indeed bring back Orion from the dead. Or so she thought. 
Phoebe did not know this at the time, but the ritual she performed did not truly bring him back from the dead. Rather, it brought a version of Orion from a different reality into this one. This Orion, whom we shall designate as Orion Nightbringer, immediately murdered his wife in the Catacombs and fled to build his evil power. Once sufficiently strong he returned to Tír na nÓg and killed each and every one of his advisors with an evil sword. Confident in his abilities he feared no one, and one by one killed each of the gods and goddesses with this accursed blade. The world that had known peace for so little time was once again plagued under his rule. 
A group of adventurers rose up to the occasion, including his own son, and together confronted Nightbringer. Orion destroyed the Mirror Portal with this blade and broke it into Seven large pieces. As a team they defeated Nightbringer and ended his threats. In doing so they Ascended and became the new gods and goddesses to replace the fallen ones. Hadron, now Hadrol the god of Magic, was the catalyst for this and was sucked into a different reality unable to return to this reality. 
Thus is the tale of Orion Dawnbringer, the Unity of Nations, The Creator of The Mirror Portal. And the sad tale of Orion Nightbringer, the End of Worlds and Calamity of Days.  
The Great Division of Nations
And the rise of the Boon
After Nightbringer was defeated the city of Tír na nÓg was in ruin. The Seven pieces of the Mirror Portal were taken by seven different people. These larger pieces became known as the Mirror Plates. Each piece was carried to a different portion of the world:
One with Hathor, a human of great strength (and an even greater love of wine) who settled in the vast farmlands in the mid-east. 
One with Sakkar, a tiefling of great cunning who retreated for privacy to the jungles and swamps of the south.
One with Leto, a halfling with spirit twice their stature who went north to prove themselves stronger than the rest.
One with Oasar, a dwarf of lore and studies who went west to the deserts in search of deeper treasure. 
One with Karnak, an orc of formidable strength who sought greatness in the northeast. 
One with Nylyryus, an elf who sought stability who settled in the central region of the world. 
And finally, one with Eleth, a dragonborn of high honor who conquered the brimstone of the mid-east between Hathor and Karnak. 
Each of these established their own kingdoms which have grown to become the modern day kingdoms of Hathoria, Sakkaret, Letopolis, Oasaria, Karnaketh, Nyle and Elethia. 
Unfortunately for Tír na nÓg this division and the lack of the Portal drove the people away. Over time the Tuatha De became a fallen people, their once glorious forms turning to shadow and horror. The citizens fled, and The Gatekeeper sealed the way to the city to prevent anyone else from falling to those horrors. The once beautiful capital of Tír na nÓg was lost to time and legend. 
The Mirror Plates were not just legendary artifacts; they grew and shed what would soon become the most valuable currency and material in the world. 
Mirror Shards. 
These small prism-shaped fragments of the larger Plates grew along the edges and naturally fell off once grown. Their properties exceeded that of any other known material. A single shard could harness the explosive power sufficient to injure even a dragon. Several attached to a weapon could alter its properties to become otherworldly. But the biggest use of all was to grant Boons to people. 
Boons were granted by using 10 of these shards in a special ceremony. A special marking would appear on their body signifying which boon they received:
A mark on the right temple for Intelligence
A mark on the left temple for Wisdom
A mark on the tongue for Charisma
A mark on the arm for Strength
A mark on the ankle for Dexterity
A mark on the heart for Constitution. 
Each came with a price: A boon in one stat would give a negative boon in another. The collection cost of the shards and how few there were prevented a Boon from being granted to each person. It was also possible that people randomly received boons in the night, claiming visions of other realities and seeing themselves receive one there. 
Fast forward a few thousand years. After many years of territorial wars and clashes of mighty Booned warriors the borders were finally defined. Tempers cooled as the initial founders slowly passed into Death’s Domain and finally the world settled into an unsteady treatise. 
Modern Geo-Politics and Nations
And the Disgrace of the Dragonborn
A time after the Division of Nations, the kingdom of Elethia had the first modern catastrophe. Their precious Mirror Plate was stolen by an unknown entity to never be seen or heard of again. Though countless have searched far and wide no trace has ever been found. Without the Mirror Shards it produced the nation suffered greatly. Their normal warriors and mages quickly fell to the Booned might of the surrounding ones. 
Although the other nations never destroyed Elethia completely, they took advantage of the relative weakness of their people. Unable to resist their stronger neighbors, Elethia soon found themselves at their mercy. Heavy taxes were levied, almost all weapons and supplies were taken. Elethia was left a barren land for generations with the people struggling to farm and stay alive. Over time the other nations grew bolder and had their border patrols pillage and torment them. 
Modern day Elethia still feels these effects, albeit mostly from Hathoria from the south. The other nations patrol the borders, but do not torment the Dragonborn. 
Religions
The Eternal View
The Eternal View follows the Pantheon of gods and goddesses and worships them. They pray to each and every one of them, recognizing the need for both “good” and “evil” in life. One may pray to Life imploring for healing of a sick friend, or to Trickery in their attempts to gain a better deal in trade. The pantheon are as follows:
Therial, goddess of Knowledge. Symbol: Burning Book
Shinorol, god of Light. Symbol: Radiant Sun
Arwial, goddess of Life. Symbol: Winged Heart
Govorol, god of Nature. Symbol: Inverted Tree
Vytial, goddess of Tempest. Symbol: Lightning Ship
Kokorol, god of Death. Symbol: Skeletal Scales
Hydrial, goddess of War. Symbol: Bloody Sword
Minothrol, god of Trickery. Symbol: Split Mask
The general population of people are unaware of the existence of a god of Magic – especially as any mention of their name sounds as static in the ears of others. Therefore, the Pantheon of Eight is the commonly accepted theology. 
Throughout the land churches can be found in every good-sized town, Cathedrals in the biggest cities, and small shrines in villages. Usually, a priest or priestess will oversee the individual churches. Cathedrals are usually run by a Chief Priest or Priestess (normally chosen by the king/queen of the nation). 
When praying, the typical person would pray to the god/goddess that most closely aligns with their desires. Prayers bring in multiple deities at once. 
Church services are not really a thing – the priest or priestess would meet with individuals to offer guidance, prayer instruction, counsel, perform marriages and death rites. Tithes are not asked – donations are expected for any of the services listed above and as an entry fee to the church (usually 1 copper a family, just to keep it running). Cathedrals may charge more. 
The Church of the True Self
A secondary religion has begun creeping up in popularity in more recent centuries. This church rejects the pantheon as divine beings and instead worships themselves. They believe that through all of the different Realities that exist, there must be at least one reality in which they are the deity. The focus is mostly on becoming the best version of yourself as possible. 
This religion also places very high importance on the Booned, almost worshiping them in their power. Any boost above a natural being is desired and celebrated. 
Those of this religion do not pray as others do. They instead “Visualize”, which means they spend time in meditation and reflection to deduce what a different version of themselves might do. They contemplate the consequences of their actions and inactions to gain guidance. This may include attempting to Visualize the consequences that others may impose on their lives. 
A key distinction between this and no religion is that they still recognize that there are extremely powerful beings of the pantheon, not that there are no deities. 
The Nobodies
While not technically a religion, they merit a space here for their unique beliefs. Those who follow this movement abandon their old lives and identities and become Nobody. They lead lives of peace and quiet, never pursuing or advancing personal strength as to never become “Somebody”. When serving in positions as guards they wear masks to cover their faces, attempting to hide every aspect of their individuality. Their government is done by election; after serving, the leader then becomes “Somebody” and never returns. 
They still believe in the pantheon as the The Church of the True Self does, and may even pray to them. However – they would never pray for personal reasons as that would recognize themselves as “Somebody”. 
The majority of the followers of this movement live in Nowhere, in the Unclaimed Hills. Followers in other cities are rare but not unheard of. They would typically keep to themselves and would be difficult to find.
Nations
Nyle
The kingdom of Nyle boasts the capital city of Lyrium, a city of progress and beauty in between two lakes. Queen Foressi rules this nation, a known Tri-Boon. The official religion is The Eternal View. Often considered the most powerful militarily of the kingdom, employing well trained soldiers and mercenaries. In times of need they also draw from their large Paladin army. Several outposts are maintained in secret locations for training with a known outpost in the capital of Lyrium. 
Oasaria
The kingdom of Oasaria lies to the east. A band of fertile land surrounds a massive desert that takes up a large portion of their territory. King Aberol rules
